## Challenge

The image shared is a wireframe of an example project you'll be building in the pairing session. It's a low fidelity wireframe for an app to track process through a series of exercises.

The idea is, as you complete a full set, you click the circle. You'd continue clicking circles until that exercise is complete. If you failed to complete all the reps within that set, you'd click the circle multiple times and the number would count down until it matches how many reps you managed to complete.

We appreciate the language of this domain can be new but don't worry - we're not worried about your understanding of exercising terminology. Your pairing partner will play Angus' role as Product Owner and answer any questions you have - so ask as many questions as you like!
